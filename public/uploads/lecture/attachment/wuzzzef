As a student in ITI opensource track I've developed many PHP projects using web and Api configurations with native PHP and Laravel framework.

In all projects applied frontend technologies using HTML5/CSS3 ,java script and angular5 and mobile deployment using IONIC2.

Alongside PHP, learned to build database with both SQL and NoSQL such as mysql and mongoDB. 

Thanks for reviewing my application and hoping to hear from you soon
